1.What is an Exception
--------------------------
An exception is an abnormal condition that arises in code during run time. It is  a 
run time error.

2.Exception class hierachy
-----------------------------
Base class of all exceptions is Throwable.It has two sub classes Exception and Error.
Error represent the errors happens in the Java runtime environment itself and it cannot
be handled in code. So we are not dealing with that.

3.Handling exception using try catch blocks
--------------------------------------------
You have to keep the code which are vulnurable to throw exceptions inside the try block.
Write the catch blocks under try block.

4.Use of finally block
------------------------
When you want to execute a code always irespective of whether exception is thrown or not then we will have 
to write that code inside finally block.
It is executed when
1.Exception is thrown but not handled
2.Exception is thrown and handled
3.No Exception
4.Forced to return using return statement
