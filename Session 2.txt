Using Throw and Throws clause
-------------------------------
throw
-------
It is possible to throw an exception in our code using throw statement.
Demo1



throws
-------------------

If a method is capable of causing an exception that it does not handle, it must specify this behavior 
so that the caller of the method can guard themselves against the exception. For that we use throws
clause in the method declaration.

Checked Exceptions and Unchecked Exceptions
----------------------------------------------
The sub classes of RuntimeException need not be included in the throws list of any methods  because the compiler
does not check whether they are handled or not. So they are called unchecked exceptions.

There are some exceptions which must be handled by the method or declared in the throws list otherwise
 the compiler will give error message. They are called checked exceptions.
